# Student-Test_Score
This project is based on analysing whether the score of a student depends on any factor or not, if so then how much. For that purpose we analyzed the data and analyzed various factors and plotted them to see if there is an impact or not. 
We used Python Libraries for that such as Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib.
